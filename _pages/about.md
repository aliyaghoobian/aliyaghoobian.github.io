My passion lies in working on emerging telecom technologies. As a Telecommunications Engineer and Researcher, I bring a strong foundation in mathematics, optimization, AI, and programming, supported by an extensive academic and professional background in wireless and communication networks. I am always eager to embrace new challenges in my field and actively seek opportunities to expand my professional network.

My research broadly falls under the domain of networks and distributed systems and in particular in the intersection of wireless and mobile networks and edge computing. Currently, my research focuses on various aspects relevant to next-generation mobile networks, including the following topics:

* Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)
* Digital Twin in Wireless Networks
* Applications of AI\ML to mobile networks
* Large-scale testbeds and experimentation
* Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing
